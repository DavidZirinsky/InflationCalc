## Getting a FRED API key ðŸ”‘
Before doing anything visit https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html to get an api key.

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the `infra` folder with the contents:
```
FRED_API_KEY = "API_KEY_YOU_GET"
```

## Deploy the backend ðŸ› 
Go to the `lambda_code_and_deps` folder:
```
cd lambda_code_and_deps/
```

Lambda dependencies can be tricky, so run this command to install the `requests` module:
```
pip install requests -t .
```

Zip it on up:
```
zip -r ../infra/lambda.zip ./*
```

Then go to the `infra` folder and run this:
```
cd ../infra
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

As a debug step you can always to this, the advatages of this command are if networking isn't set up you can still test that the lambda is running. The AWS console is also quite helpful
```
aws lambda invoke --function-name inflation_lambda response.json
```
## Running the Frontend ðŸ› 

In the frontend directory, you can do the following:

Run the debub server:
```
npm start
```
Run tests:
```
npm test
```

Create a production build:
```
npm run build
```
